# Help for Ukraine web banner

This is a simple banner you can place on your website. This banner will guide your visitors to information about how to reliably and effectively help Ukraine and its people.

## How to implement

Simply link a single minified JavaScript file like this example:

```html
<script src="https://bianocz.github.io/ua-banner/dist/cz.1.0.4.min.js" defer></script>
```

You can find more information along with links to the current version for different languages on the [project site](https://bianocz.github.io/ua-banner/).
